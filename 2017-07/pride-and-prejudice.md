A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.

骄傲多半不外乎我们对我们自己的估价，虚荣却牵涉到我们希望别人对我们的看法

We can all begin freely - a slight preference is natural enough, but here are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show more affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.

恋爱的开头都是随随便便——某人对某人发生点儿好感，本是极其自然的一回事；只可惜没有对方的鼓励而自己就肯没头没脑去钟情的人，简直太少了。女人家十有八九都是心里有一分爱表面上就露出两分。毫无问题，彬格莱喜欢你姐姐；可是你姐姐如果不帮他一把劲，他也许喜欢喜欢她就算了。”

If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, ...

要是我存心要在音乐上出风头，我真要对你感激不尽

Keep your breath to cool your porridge
